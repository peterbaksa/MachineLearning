# Machine Learning project 
This project contains and will be updated for all machine learning techniques that I learned and practiced in 
python language. Most of them will be written as Jupyter Notebooks to better demonstrate how they work and there is
also more space to write readable and student friendly notes/pictures/videos..

## Current projects:
