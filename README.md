# Machine Learning project 
This project contains and will be updated for all machine learning techniques that I learned and practiced in 
python language. Most of them will be written as Jupyter Notebooks to better demonstrate how they work and there is
also more space to write readable and student friendly notes/pictures/videos..

### Current projects:

## 1. Linear Regression 
Check the sub-projetct project [Linear Regression](01_Linear_Regression/readme.md)

This project contains explanation of Linear Regression. Starting from base model to model with vectorisation, 
feature engineering, feature scaling and visualizations.

[1. Base of linear regression](01_Linear_Regression/01_base_of_linear_regression/readme.md)
- Contains model, cost function, gradient descent, training and visualization <br>

[2. Linear Regression on dataset](01_Linear_Regression/02_linear_regression_on_dataset/readme.md)
- Explains how to read data from CSV file, split to inputs and outputs and build model upon this data<br>

[3. Multiple feature](01_Linear_Regression/03_multiple_features/readme.md) 
- Explains how linear regression works with 2 features, compares 1 feature model vs 2 feature model

[4. Feature scaling](01_Linear_Regression/04_feature_scaling/readme.md)
- Explains what is data scaling and how to apply MinMax normalization on dataset

[5. Other feature scaling techiques](01_Linear_Regression/05_other_feature_scaling_techniques/readme.md)
- Explains other feature scaling methods and their implementation

[6. Vectorization](01_Linear_Regression/06_vectorization/readme.md)
- Explains how to appli vectorization on 1 feature model, 2 features model and multiple feature model + 
 computing speed compare: of non vectorized and vectorized model
[7. Feature engineering](01_Linear_Regression/07_feature_engineering/readme.md)

## 2. Data preprocessing

## 3 Classification - Logistic regression
