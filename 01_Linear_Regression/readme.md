# Linear Regression
To start with machine learning you have to understand the base building stone: <b>Linear Regression</b>

LR is a supervised machine learning technique. This means that we have to give input and also output data in to model. Model 
is then possible to evaluate (reach the goal) its value (cost / error) and train itself to do the best. 

Method of Linear Regression fits the curve upon training data to best fit the distance from given input data.
Linear in the naming of method determines that the base of this method is to find the linear curve to fit the goal.

Curve equation: 
### y = a.x + c
where:<br>
- x - is value on x axis
- a - defines slope
- c - define the cross of the line (model) on y - axis in x = 0 point

In machine learning we use this version:
### y = f(x) = w.x + b
- x - input parameter
- w - weight (model parameter)
- b - bias (model parameter)

## COST FUNCTION - Mean Squared Error

To measure the cost of goal is the MSR (Mean Squared Error) function the most used.
